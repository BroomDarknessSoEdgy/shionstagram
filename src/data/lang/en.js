		bio: "Murasaki Shion is a Vtuber who debuted on August 17, 2018, as a member of hololive's 2nd generation. She's a self-proclaimed genius who graduated from Harvard and dark magic is her specialty.\n\nShe's more commonly known as a brat who likes to make fun of people, but inside she's a really nice, kind, and considerate girl. Although her proficiency in dark magic has not been showcased so far, she certainly has the power to make everyone smile.",
		clip_description:
			"This project started with a passing thought: \"Wouldn't it be funny to celebrate Shion's one million subcribers with something she hates?\" and so we made an Instagram-like site to gather fan messages, among other features, for the witch we all deeply appreciate. We wanted to make something original that would be more than just a place to display messages, so we also made a soundboard with the help of multiple artists and people from the EN Shiokko server. All in all, this is the result of fans, both Japanese and overseas, who wanted to show Murasaki Shion the love and appreciation that she deserves for all her hard work. Congratulations on the one million subscribers!",
